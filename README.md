# Assembler-Project
The project requires you to design an Assembler which takes a text file as an input, which contains the Assembly code. The assembler must be able to translate the assembly code into machine code. The machine code generated must also be saved in a separate text file.
There are no Macros and Procedures to be assembled. Error reporting strategy has been handled. Assumed all operands are declared at the end of instructions, sequentially and in order of their appearance in the code. Each operand occupies one word.
